# CO493 - Probabilistic Inference - Bayesian Optimisation Coursework

## Requirements

```bash
pip install matplotlib scipy numpy keras tensorflow
```

## Assignments

All the descriptions of the tasks are described in the *jupyter notebook*: `bayesian_optimisation.ipynb`

## Important notes: How to run tests and submit your code

### Using LabTS to test your code

You will be assigned a personal Gitlab repository, in which you will have do your assignment.
From that repo, each time you push a commit, you will be able to run some tests on [LabTS](https://teaching.doc.ic.ac.uk/labts).
Those tests will provide you feedback about the validity of your results.

### Using LabTS to submit your coursework

To submit to CATe, you **have to** go to [LabTS](https://teaching.doc.ic.ac.uk/labts), and click on the button `Submit to CATe` that is associated to the commit that contains the code you wish to submit.

If you have any question or comment, feel free to ask on Piazza, or during the tutorials ;)
